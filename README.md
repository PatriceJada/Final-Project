# Final-Project

For my Final project I decided to create a Recipe Book. I think one of the most funniest thing about doing this project was a syntax error I came across that took me 2 days to figure out. It was a uneeded comma I had accidentally placed and wouldn't let me run my project. This was my first ever time using Django and I honestly had a enjoyable time learning about how to use the program. During the project I had run into a lot of errors which really slowed down my process but I was able to push through most of them and I learned a lot while doing so. Another thing I also learned is that I love to program on a white board :) . This is one of the projects I look forward to coming back and working on. 

Here is the Link to my project:
