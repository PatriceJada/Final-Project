# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

My Recipe Book

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows you to store your recipes.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The website will have a user interface. It will be written in HTML and Python. I will be using Django, a python based web framework to build the front end of the website. I will also be using SQLite/MangoDB to store user information in a database. I want the recipes to be easily shareable through email and text. There will be a page to see all your recipes they can be sorted into categories such as breakfast, dinner, or snacks.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A will accomplish the front end of the website along with the user interface.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome will be setting up the database to collect information.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to have the website up and running. Where it takes the user login and recipes and adds it to the database.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps include researching how to create a database to store the recipes as well as creating a user interface. Then I will start the front end of the project creating the template and web design, next I will move onto the back end and begin coding for the database and user interface to interact with the front end.
